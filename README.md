# Luke Mao Resume

This is my personal resume website, built with `shadcn` and `vite`. It records my summary, work experience, education, and projects. The website is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly. Visitors can also leave me a message or job opportunity through the websiteâ€™s contact form, and I will receive it directly via email.

Please view the live demo at [www.lukemao.site](https://www.lukemao.site).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# create a .env file at the project root with your EmailJS credentials:
# (You can get these from your EmailJS dashboard)
VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_EMAIL_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key

# run dev server
npm run dev
``` 

And open the webpage at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
